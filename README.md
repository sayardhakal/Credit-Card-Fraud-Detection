# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project, I have build credit card fraud detection using python machine learning. I have used logistic regression model for model training.The dataset used in the project is taken from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).The dataset highly unbalanced.To solve it, I have done under-sampling. Overall process are listed below:
1. Data collection and pre-processing
2. Data analysis
3. Train test split
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Building predictive system
